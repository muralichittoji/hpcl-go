As a result, the interval between applications of lubricant can be increased when HYTAK grades are employed. HYTAK F 4 and F 5 contain a non-flammable solvent for easy application without heating. After the application, the solvent evaporates leaving behind a tacky film that will neither be squeezed aside by the meshing action of teeth nor thrown off by centrifugal force. Additionally, extreme and tackiness additives are incorporated in these products to impart extreme-pressure lubricating properties and improve their rust-preventing characteristics.",
